Use BEFORE writing any report. One wrong answer = kill the finding and move on. Saves N/A ratio.

# TRIAGE & VALIDATION

One wrong answer = STOP **this finding**. Kill **the finding**. Move on **to the next test class**.

> **Scope of "STOP" in this skill:** This skill's gates kill INDIVIDUAL FINDINGS that fail validation. They do NOT authorize stopping the engagement. Killing a finding via the 7-Question Gate just means *that finding* doesn't get submitted — every other test class in the engagement is still pending. See `redteam-mindset` "DO NOT STOP primary directive" for the coverage-axis rule.

> "N/A hurts your validity ratio. Informative is neutral. Only submit what passes all 7 questions."

## THE 7-QUESTION GATE

Ask IN ORDER. One wrong answer = STOP immediately.

---

### Q1: Can an attacker use this RIGHT NOW, step by step?

Complete this template:
```
1. Setup:   I need [own account / another user's ID / no account]
2. Request: [exact HTTP method, URL, headers, body — copy-paste ready]
3. Result:  I can [read / modify / delete] [exact data shown in response]
4. Impact:  The real-world consequence is [account takeover / PII read / money stolen]
5. Cost:    Time: [X minutes], Capital: [$0 / $X subscription required]
```

**If you CANNOT write step 2 as a real HTTP request → KILL IT.**

---

### Q2: Is the impact on the program's accepted impact list?

Go to the program page. Find "Vulnerability Types" or "Out of Scope."

Common tiers:
- **Critical**: Any-user ATO without interaction, RCE, SQLi with data exfil, admin auth bypass
- **High**: Mass PII exfil, privilege escalation, internal SSRF with data, stored XSS all users
- **Medium**: IDOR on specific user non-critical data, XSS on sensitive page requiring click
- **Low**: Non-sensitive info disclosure, clickjacking with PoC

**If your bug maps to a listed exclusion → KILL IT.**

---

### Q3: Is the root cause in an in-scope asset?

Confirm:
- Vulnerable domain is on the in-scope list (not `*.internal.target.com`)
- It's a production asset (not staging/dev unless explicitly in scope)
- It's not a third-party service the company just uses (not Stripe, Salesforce, Google Auth)

**If out-of-scope → KILL IT.**

---

### Q4: Does it require privileged access that an attacker can't realistically get?

- "Admin can do X" = centralization risk = **KILL IT** (on 99% of programs)
- "Non-admin can do X that only admin should do" = valid
- "Requires physical access / MFA device" = usually invalid
- "Requires compromised victim account to work" = questionable, low severity at best

---

### Q5: Is this already known or accepted behavior?

Search:
1. Program's HackerOne/Bugcrowd disclosed reports: Ctrl+F endpoint name + bug class
2. GitHub issues on target repo: `is:issue label:security ENDPOINT_NAME`
3. Changelog/CHANGELOG.md — does it mention this behavior?
4. API docs / design docs — is it documented as intended?

**If acknowledged/design decision → KILL IT.**

---

### Q6: Can you prove impact beyond "technically possible"?

- XSS → show actual cookie theft or session hijack, not just `alert(1)` or `alert(document.domain)`
- SSRF → hit an internal endpoint that returns data, not just DNS ping
- SQLi → show actual data exfil from a real table, not just error message
- IDOR → show actual other-user's data in response, not just a 200 status code

**If you can only show "technically possible" → DOWNGRADE severity, not kill.**

---

### Q7: Is this a known-invalid bug class?

Check the NEVER SUBMIT list below. If it's on this list without a chain → **KILL IT.**
